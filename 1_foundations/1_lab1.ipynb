      "\n",
      "**Step-by-step solution:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Convert the train's speed to miles per minute:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 60 miles per hour:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",

      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "But the train length \\(T\\) is not given directly. It turns out that the length of the train isn't necessary if we consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The **duration** to completely pass through the tunnel (from the front of the train entering the tunnel to the rear leaving) equals time for the train's front to reach the other end, plus the length of the train to clear.\n",

      "\n",
      "- When the front of the train enters the tunnel, it takes \\(T_{front}\\) to reach the end of the tunnel. Since speed = 1 mile/min, then the time for the front of the train to reach the end of the tunnel is:\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "t_{front} = L \\text{ minutes}\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "L + L_{train} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "But absent more info, the **only way** for the entire train to pass through in 1 minute at 1 mile/minute is if the length of the train is negligible or if we assume the train length equals the tunnel length for simplicity. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Alternatively**, the standard interpretation in such problems is: \n",
      "\n",
      "- The train length is equal to the distance the train covers in the time they specify, which is 1 mile in 1 minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The train is traveling at 60 mph = 1 mile/minute, and it passes completely through the tunnel in 1 minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "- During that time, the train moves 1 mile, which includes the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train passing through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, **the length of the tunnel is the distance traveled minus the length of the train**:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "L_t = \\text{distance traveled in 1 minute} - \\text{train length}\n",
      "\\]\n",

      "But since the train is traveling at 1 mile/minute and passes through the tunnel in 1 minute, the entire length of the train plus the tunnel is 1 mile.\n",

      "\n",
      "- If the train's length is negligible (assuming point object), then the tunnel length is 1 mile. But usually, the train has a length, say \\(L_{train}\\).\n",

      "\n",
